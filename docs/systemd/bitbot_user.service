# This systemd script was made to be used in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
# Check your distro and make the appropriate changes if needed
# In order to allow the user to run their own systemd scripts
# you need to type the following as root:
# loginctl enable-linger $USER (replace $USER with the shell username)
# User systemd scripts are placed inside /home/$USER/.config/systemd/user
# All commands are issued as: systemctl --user [start|stop|restart|reload|enable|disable] service_name.service
# If the folder doesn't exist, type: systemctl --user enable systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer
# This will automatically create the folder and enable the tempfiles clean timer,
# which can be disabled with: systemctl --user disable systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer
#
# After placing this script in the correct location, and with bitbot stopped, type:
# systemcl --user daemon-reload
# Afert that start bitbot with:
# systemctl --user enable bitbot_user.service --now
# This will enable the systemd script and launch bitbot
